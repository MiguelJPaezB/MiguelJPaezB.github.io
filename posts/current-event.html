                    Technology has completely transformed the way we communicate, work, and live.
                    It allows us to stay connected with people from every corner of the world — 
                    yet, ironically, it sometimes distances us from those sitting right next to us.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, it’s common to see groups of friends or families gathered together, but 
                    instead of talking, everyone is looking at their own screen.
                    Social media, online games, and digital entertainment have gradually replaced 
                    many of our genuine face-to-face conversations and emotional interactions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While technology makes our lives easier and more efficient, it also creates 
                    invisible barriers.
                    We spend hours scrolling through updates, likes, and notifications, forgetting 
                    the warmth of eye contact and the power of a real smile.
                    Little by little, we risk losing one of the most essential parts of being human 
                    — authentic connection.

                <h2>How Technology Affects Human Relationships</h2>
                <p>
                    Constant use of smartphones and social networks has made communication faster but also more superficial. 
                    Many people prefer texting instead of talking, or reacting to posts instead of expressing real emotions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This excessive dependence on technology can create emotional distance. We share photos and statuses, but we forget to look into someone’s eyes or listen carefully when they speak.

                <p>
                    This video invites us to think critically about how technology influences our daily lives.
                    It questions whether our devices truly connect us or make us feel more isolated, and how 
                    digital habits affect our health, relationships, and society as a whole.

                    After watching this video, I realized that technology itself is neutral — it’s our behavior that defines its impact.
                    If we use it with awareness and balance, it can help us learn, communicate, and grow.
                    But if we depend on it too much, it can replace real experiences and weaken our human connections.

                <h3>My Reflection</h3>
                <p>
                    I think it’s important to use technology responsibly and remember that real communication happens when we truly connect with others. 
                    Eye contact, empathy, and presence can never be replaced by emojis or likes.
                </p>

                    This topic made me reflect on how I use my own devices. 
                    Now I try to put my phone away when spending time with my family or friends, and I feel more connected and calm.

                <h3>What I Learned</h3>
                <p>
                    Writing this post helped me practice expressing opinions and feelings in English using the present continuous and simple tenses. 
                    I also improved my vocabulary related to emotions, technology, and communication.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I learned that technology is a tool — how we use it determines whether it connects or separates us.
