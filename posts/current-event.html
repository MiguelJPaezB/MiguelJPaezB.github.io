                    One of the most interesting current topics for me is how <strong>social media platforms influence the way people receive news</strong>.
                    I recently read an article about how young people are using apps like TikTok and Instagram as their main sources of information.
                    This topic caught my attention because it shows how communication and media have changed over time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The article explained that, while social media allows us to access information faster, 
                    it can also spread fake news and misinformation very easily.
                    This made me reflect on the importance of <strong>media literacy</strong> — 
                    learning to identify reliable sources and think critically about what we see online.

                <h2>My Opinion</h2>
                <p>
                    I believe that social media is a great tool for communication and learning, 
                    but we must be responsible users. 
                    Before sharing or believing in any information, it is important to check the source and think twice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also think schools should teach more about media literacy, 
                    so young people can learn how to recognize manipulation, bias, and fake news.

                <h3>What I Learned</h3>
                <p>
                    Writing this post helped me practice using the <strong>present simple tense</strong> and <strong>expressing opinions</strong> in English.
                    It also helped me improve my vocabulary related to media, technology, and communication.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I learned that being informed today means more than just reading — it means analyzing, comparing, and understanding what we consume online.
