                    The topic of <strong>crime and punishment</strong> is complex and often controversial. 
                    Around the world, people have different opinions about what justice really means and how criminals should be treated.  
                    Some believe that punishment must be strict to prevent future crimes, while others think rehabilitation and education are more effective.

                    In many cases, the debate goes beyond laws — it touches moral and emotional questions about forgiveness, equality, and human rights.
                    Every decision in a justice system affects not only the offender, but also the victims, families, and the entire community.
                    That’s why understanding this topic requires both critical thinking and empathy.

                <h2>What People Say About Justice</h2>
                <p>
                    During my English lessons, I learned how to use <strong>reported speech</strong> to share other people’s opinions and ideas. 
                    For example:
                </p>
                <ul style="margin-left: 30px;">
                    <li>The police officer said that <em>everyone must respect the law.</em></li>
                    <li>The journalist explained that <em>crime rates had increased in the city.</em></li>
                    <li>My teacher mentioned that <em>education can prevent violence.</em></li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    These examples helped me understand how we can express thoughts and reports in English in a formal and structured way.

                <h2>My Reflection on Justice</h2>
                <p>
                    I believe that justice should not only punish but also help people learn from their mistakes.  
                    Everyone deserves a second chance if they are willing to change and make things right.  
                    Society becomes stronger when we focus on fairness, empathy, and education instead of revenge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As I studied this topic, I realized how important it is to understand both the laws and the human stories behind each case.  
                    We can’t talk about punishment without thinking about compassion and respect for life.

                    Crime and punishment is a topic that always makes me reflect deeply. It is interesting and sometimes difficult because
                     it forces us to think about what is fair and how people should face the consequences of their actions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I believe that justice should not only focus on punishment, but also on learning and change. When someone commits a 
                    crime, it is important for them to take responsibility, but society should also offer the opportunity to rebuild their 
                    life. Education, empathy, and rehabilitation can help people grow and become better, instead of feeling rejected or 
                    without hope.

                    Every country has different laws and different ways to apply justice, but the goal should always be the same — to 
                    protect others and promote peace. If we focus only on revenge, we create more anger and division. However, when we 
                    choose fairness, understanding, and compassion, we help build a stronger and more humane community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Writing about this topic in English helped me practice reported speech and express more complex ideas. It also reminded
                     me that justice begins with respect, kindness, and the willingness to help others make better choices.

                    This topic allowed me to practice reported speech and express opinions about moral and social issues in English.  
                    It also helped me develop critical thinking by comparing justice systems and understanding the importance of empathy.
