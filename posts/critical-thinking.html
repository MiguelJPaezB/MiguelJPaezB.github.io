                    In today’s world, we are surrounded by information — on social media, TV, news websites, and even memes. 
                    Sometimes it’s difficult to know what’s true and what’s not. 
                    That’s why <strong>critical thinking</strong> and <strong>media literacy</strong> are so important.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These skills help us analyze, evaluate, and understand the messages we see every day. 
                    Instead of believing everything immediately, we can question it, verify sources, and make our own conclusions.

                <h2>How Media Can Influence Our Thinking</h2>
                <p>
                    Media has a strong influence on our emotions, opinions, and even our decisions. 
                    Advertisements, news, and influencers often try to persuade us in subtle ways.
                    Developing <strong>media literacy</strong> allows us to detect bias, recognize manipulation, and think independently.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, a video or post can make us feel angry or excited, even if the information is not complete or true. 
                    When we use critical thinking, we pause and ask: “Who created this message?”, “Why?”, and “Is it reliable?”.

                <h3>My Reflection</h3>
                <p>
                    I think being a critical thinker means not accepting information blindly. 
                    It’s about being curious, asking questions, and searching for the truth. 
                    Media literacy helps me identify when something is fake or exaggerated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a student of software analysis and development, I often use the internet to research or learn new things. 
                    Thanks to critical thinking, I can choose better sources and understand technology in a more responsible way.

                <h3>What I Learned</h3>
                <p>
                    Through this post, I practiced expressing opinions and connecting ideas in English using logical connectors like “because”, “so”, and “therefore”.
                    I also learned new vocabulary related to communication, reasoning, and media.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This activity reminded me that learning a language is not only about grammar, but also about understanding the world and how we communicate within it.
