                <h1>My Family and Hobbies</h1>
                <p>
                    My family is very important to me. I currently live with my sister and my nephew. 
                    My brother lives with his wife and daughters, and my father lives at my grandmother’s 
                    house — we all live in Barranquilla. <br>
                    My mother, however, lives in a small rural area called Las Tinas, in Corozal – Sucre. 
                    Even though we are far from each other, we always stay connected and support one another.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We enjoy spending time together, especially on weekends when we gather at my grandmother’s 
                    house to have lunch and talk. Sometimes we also go to the movies as a family. <br>
                    They are my greatest motivation to keep learning and growing every day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my daily life, I do many things: I work at Kairós, I also design websites as a freelance 
                    web designer, I take care of my nephews, and I study.

                <h2>My Favorite Hobbies</h2>
                <p>
                    In my free time, I like doing activities that help me relax and learn new things.<br>
                    One of my favorite hobbies is listening to music — it helps me concentrate and improve 
                    my English listening and pronunciation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also love drawing on my tablet. I usually learn digital art techniques through tutorials 
                    I find on YouTube or in online forums. I prefer to watch them in English because I can 
                    find what I need faster, and it also helps me improve my understanding of the language.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another hobby I really enjoy is learning new songs. I play several instruments, but my 
                    favorite one is the guitar. I like searching for songs and taking the time to learn 
                    them — I try to play them by ear, although sometimes it’s a bit difficult.<br>
                    Recently, the artists I listen to the most are Ed Sheeran, Imagine Dragons, and System of a Down.

                    This audio is a short personal introduction where I talk a little more about myself, my family, 
                    and what I like to do in my free time.

                <h3>What I Learned</h3>
                <p>
                    Talking about my family and hobbies helped me practice the use of <strong>present simple tense</strong> and <strong>possessive 
                    adjectives</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It also helped me improve my pronunciation while describing people and things I like.<br>
                    This activity made me realize how English can connect my daily life with my learning goals.
                </p>
