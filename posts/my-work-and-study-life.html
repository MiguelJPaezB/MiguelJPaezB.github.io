                    Managing my time between work and study has been one of the biggest challenges in my daily life. 
                    I currently work at <strong>Kairos</strong> and also as a <strong>freelance web designer</strong>. 
                    My days are full of projects, meetings, and tasks, but I always try to organize my time to keep learning and growing.

                <p>
                    English plays a very important role in my professional life. 
                    Most of the tools, tutorials, and documentation I use are in English, 
                    so understanding the language helps me work faster and communicate better with clients and developers.

                <p>
                    Every morning, I start my day early to check emails and organize the tasks I need to do. 
                    After that, I dedicate a few hours to work on website designs and coding. 
                    In the afternoon, I take time to study and complete my activities from the SENA program in Software Analysis and Development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I try to keep a good balance between productivity and rest. Sometimes I take short breaks to listen to music or 
                    watch English videos that help me practice pronunciation and expand my vocabulary.

                <p>
                    Writing about my work and studies helped me use the <strong>present simple tense</strong> and expressions 
                    related to routines and habits. It also helped me practice connecting ideas with transition words like <em>after that</em>, 
                    <em>then</em>, and <em>finally</em>.
