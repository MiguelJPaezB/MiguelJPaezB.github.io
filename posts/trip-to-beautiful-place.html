                    Colombia is full of amazing natural places, and one of the most special for me is <strong>Las Tinas</strong>, 
                    a small rural area near Corozal, Sucre. My mother’s family is from there, and it’s a place 
                    full of memories, peace, and nature.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the beginning of the year, I took a short trip to visit my mother, who lives there with my grandparents.<br>
                    The landscape of the Sucre savanna is beautiful — vast fields where the land blesses the farmers with good 
                    harvests, clean air, and kind people everywhere.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the day, it was very hot — perfect weather to sit under a mango tree eating watermelon.<br>
                    At night, the early-year breeze made the temperature drop, ideal for going to the main square 
                    to hang out with friends and watch the older men playing parqués, dominoes, and cards.<br>
                    That’s how I enjoyed the calm and simplicity of life far from the city.

                <h2>My Experience During the Trip</h2>
                <p>
                    During my visit, I spent time with my mother and other relatives.<br>
                    The day I arrived, my mom welcomed me with mote de queso (my favorite dish).<br>
                    We talked for hours and shared stories about our lives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also visited my friends who live in nearby villages, took many pictures and 
                    videos, and helped my grandmother take care of her garden.<br>
                    With my grandfather, I went to the fields, where we harvested cassava, yam, mango, tamarind, and passion fruit.<br>
                    We even hunted a rabbit and went fishing with my uncle Carlos.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was a great opportunity to disconnect from technology and enjoy nature.<br>
                    I realized how important it is to take time for myself and appreciate the little things:<br>
                    the song of the birds, the wind, and the peace that comes from being close to family.

                <h3>What I Learned</h3>
                <p>
                    Writing about my trip helped me practice the <strong>past simple tense</strong> 
                    to describe experiences and actions from the past. 
                    It also helped me use adjectives to describe places and express feelings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This trip reminded me of the importance of family, nature, and taking time to rest — 
                    things that are sometimes forgotten in daily life.
